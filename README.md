Bike Store Sales Analaysis - SQL: In this project, I used a dataset found on Kaggle to create database, draw ER diagram using mysql and identify the sales trends. By dissecting the data and conducting in-depth analyses, I answered key questions such as:

- How do sales trends vary across different product categories?
- Are there regional differences in consumer preferences and purchasing behavior?
- What opportunities exist for business growth and market expansion?
